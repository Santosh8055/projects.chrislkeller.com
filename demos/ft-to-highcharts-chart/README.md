### <del>ft-to-highcharts-chart</del>

<del>Further stripping down the [Fusion-Tables-To-Highcharts project](https://github.com/chrislkeller/Fusion-Tables-To-Highcharts), this uses [Google Fusion Tables](http://www.google.com/fusiontables/) as a data backend to draw a chart that uses the [Highcharts.js](http://www.highcharts.com/) library.</del>

<del>Unlike the previous project, this doesn't include a map, and therefore isn't relying on a click event to draw the chart.</del>

### Demo: fusion tables to highcharts, now using tabletop instead of fusion tables

Use [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) to pull json from Google Spreadsheet and feed it to a chart made with [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/).

Demo made possible thanks to the open source work of [Jonathan Soma](http://twitter.com/dangerscarf).
